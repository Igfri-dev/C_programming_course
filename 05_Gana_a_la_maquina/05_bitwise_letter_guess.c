/*
select a random char (lowercase)(ASCII [97 - 122][a-z])(rand())
number of oportunities (10)
correct guesses (0)
get the user guess
compare the user guess with the actual char
    if the user insert a EOF he loses the match
    if the user guess is wrong
        reduce oportunities by 1
    if the user guess is correct
        user wins the match and program ends
the computer get a random char for his guess (better if it can't repeat)
    if the computer guess is wrong
        nothing happens (computer is inmortal)
    if the computer guess is correct
        computer wins the match and program ends
if no one guesses correctly the char repeat until the user or the computer wins or the users ends with no oportunities

For dysplay purposes, the game board will be printed in a 4x7 grid format.
where each cell represents a letter from 'a' to 'z'.
and when a letter is guessed, it will be replaced with either 'U' for user or 'C' for computer.

Core Design & Logic:
 - Letters guessed are tracked using a single 32-bit integer (`played_letters`), where each 
   bit represents whether a letter has been played.
 - Ownership of guessed letters (user vs computer) is tracked using another 32-bit integer
   (`ownership_flags`), where a 1 means the user guessed it.
 - The overall game state, including remaining lives and win conditions, is stored in an 
   8-bit value (`game_data`), using lower 4 bits for lives and specific bits for win flags.
 - The user's input is read using `getchar()` and stored in a signed 8-bit variable 
   (`int8_t`) to correctly detect EOF (`-1`).
 - Bitwise operations are used to check, update, and mark letter guesses efficiently,
   replacing the need for arrays, reducing memory usage and improving CPU cache performance.

This implementation emphasizes performance, minimal memory footprint, and clear output formatting 
using ANSI escape sequences for screen control and colored output.
